"""Rez ``build_system`` plugin so ``rez-build`` can drive pcons.

When this module is registered as a rez plugin (via the
``[project.entry-points."rez.plugins.build_system"]`` table in pcons's
``pyproject.toml``), rez auto-detects any package whose source dir
contains ``pcons-build.py`` and uses :class:`PconsBuildSystem` to build
it — same flow rez uses for ``CMakeLists.txt`` with the cmake plugin.

A package opts in by setting ``build_system = "pcons"`` in ``package.py``,
or rez auto-detects pcons if no ``build_system`` is specified. If a
source dir contains both ``pcons-build.py`` and ``CMakeLists.txt``, rez's
auto-detection is order-dependent — set ``build_system = "pcons"`` (or
``"cmake"``) explicitly to disambiguate.

The plugin runs three phases inside the rez-resolved context:

1. **Configure** — invoke ``pcons generate`` (which executes
   ``pcons-build.py`` and writes ``build.ninja``) in the package source
   directory, with ``PCONS_BUILD_DIR``, ``PCONS_INSTALL_DIR``, and
   ``PCONS_GENERATOR`` set as env vars.
2. **Build** — invoke ``ninja -C <build_path>`` (or ``make -C ...``).
3. **Install** — if rez requested it, invoke ``ninja -C <build_path>
   install``. The user's ``pcons-build.py`` must declare ``Install()``
   targets pointing at ``$PCONS_INSTALL_DIR`` for this to do anything.

This module imports :mod:`rez.build_system` at top level; it is only
imported by rez itself (or by tests that explicitly opt in via
``pytest.importorskip("rez")``).
