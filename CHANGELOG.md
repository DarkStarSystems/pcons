## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Multi-toolchain support**: Environments can now have multiple toolchains for mixed-language builds (e.g., C++ with CUDA)
- **Clang-CL toolchain**: MSVC-compatible Clang driver for Windows with platform-aware defaults
- **AuxiliaryInputHandler**: New mechanism for files passed directly to downstream tools (e.g., `.def` files to linker)
- **Windows resource compiler**: MSVC toolchain now supports `.rc` files compiled to `.res`
- **Assembly support**: Added `.s`, `.S` (GCC/LLVM) and `.asm` (MASM) source file handling
- **Metal shader support**: Added `.metal` file compilation on macOS
- **User Guide**: Comprehensive documentation covering all pcons features

### Changed

- `find_c_toolchain()` now uses platform-aware defaults: prefers clang-cl/msvc on Windows, llvm/gcc on Unix
- Toolchains now provide `get_archiver_tool_name()` for correct archiver selection (MSVC uses `lib`, others use `ar`)

### Fixed

- Cross-platform support for C examples (02-06) now working on Windows with MSVC
- Concat example (01) now works on Windows using `cmd /c type`

### Infrastructure

- CI now runs MSVC tests on Windows
- Release workflow waits for CI to pass before publishing
